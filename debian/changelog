ros-rolling-ros-babel-fish (3.25.2-1noble) noble; urgency=high

  * Refactored array size templating and improved compile time checks by moving checks to constexpr.
    Fixes (#11 <https://github.com/LOEWE-emergenCITY/ros_babel_fish/issues/11>).
    This reduces the potential for errors and allows easier compile time checking.
    Many checks are also moved to constexpr and static assertions catching common errors at compile time instead of run time.
  * Use no declaration instead of static assert for compilers that evaluate it even when not used.
  * Added a method to get the actual underlying message from a compound message.
    Usage:
    using geometry_msgs::msg::Point;
    Point point = compound["position"].as<CompoundMessage>().message<Point>();

ros-rolling-ros-babel-fish (0.9.5-1noble) noble; urgency=high

  * Fixes to compile on Rolling. (#8 <https://github.com/LOEWE-emergenCITY/ros_babel_fish/issues/8>)
    * Fixes to compile on Rolling.
    ROS 2 Rolling has made two changes that cause this package
    to not build in its current form:
    1. The TRACEPOINT macro has been renamed to TRACETOOLS_TRACEPOINT.
    2. The action_tutorials_interface package has been removed,
    since it was duplicating an action that was already available
    in example_interfaces.
    This commit fixes both of these issues.
