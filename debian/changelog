    * Fixes to compile on Rolling.
    ROS 2 Rolling has made two changes that cause this package
    to not build in its current form:
    1. The TRACEPOINT macro has been renamed to TRACETOOLS_TRACEPOINT.
    2. The action_tutorials_interface package has been removed,
    since it was duplicating an action that was already available
    in example_interfaces.
    This commit fixes both of these issues.
